knowing myself 
my problems 
changes:-
1)i should not be eating anything this healthy such as the jinni dosaa that i had, i won't from now coz:-
a) that doesn't suit my pocket , i would want to save for the lesser privileged ones and hence should not spend on these things which are just waste.
b) it long term impacts my health , considering my gall bladder has to be taken out, i won't have these.
c)considering short term health , these dosaa cause a  hormonal imbalance in me , which doesn't allow me to focus on my work , which is bad , plus it also is related to indigestion of mine. coz i certainly don't want this uneasy feeling that i m having rn , and trust me , when i have eaten healthy and i feel healthy , my mind has better control and i have better control over my mind , so i m not easily distracted by my thoughts , and i conquer them better , which helps me work proefficiently. i ll talk to u later ;)
so basically i would just try to reduce such eatings , and either i would look at healthier options , which won't cause 3 most specifically and 2 as well , or either i will eat these things only when i m too much craved for, ig allowing for once in a week for this month , we will adjust this no. accordingly and mindfully in the near future.

2)(very very important)  shaant  mann rakhna seekh , refer to positives(1) , i have seen u , how u perform , once u r confident and have shaant antarmann , u r fabulous , and the guy u want to be , u surely become one , so very imp to have shaant antarmann 

3) belief and health together makes you do wonders. i'm seriously telling you , whatever you wanna do , just tell yourself multiple times , that i m gonna do this , i m gonna do this ,.. and you will surely do that , like getting grades in 3rd sem , like today waking up , like that iitd trip , like that debate amidst 600 log , all u said to urself is , no matter what , i m gonna be extroverted , i m gonna dominate the debate , i m gonna wake up at time tomorrow , i m gonna have an A and atleast a B in these courses , and that's exactly what you did, so just tell yourself that in this winter , i m gonna do dsa and prof project, these are the two things i want to sign in to , and yes i'm gonna do it.

4) "Women are more interested in the guys , not fighting for their attention , so its not like you don't talk to them or ignore them, speak to them just as you would to a normal friend of yours , be cool , make little jokes , but never be too clingy into her , show some moments of chivalry , humour , and that's it, go onto live your own life , boi , be a nice easy to approach person for them as well, like have a smiling vibe around you , one that i feel around daksh , Brinda , those people speak with a smile on their face , and it always feels nice to talk to them , so always carry a smile :-
1. don't be attention seeky , writing long messages , wanting them to want you
2. greet people with a nice smile and have that attitude 
3. have humour
4. show chivalry
5. be a nice easy to approach person , convert those awkward moments, into nicest moments
6. be outspoken , don't ignore.

5)learn to care abt ur things : one thing , i noticed here, was that yes your clothes looked better , and that's what Himesh and Arnav said , that u wear nice clothes , but it's just that ur clothes look battered , and now the same clothes looked better , bcoz my mom washed them, so basically , i feel u have the right clothes , the right specs , learn to care about ur things, atleast now that u have noticed about ur clothes , and in 3rd sem we learnt about taking care of ur notes , u would wanna make them in one copy only, make sure to sort ur photo notes in order , aur copy gumm mat krna , and plz don't ruin ur clothes, like keeping them here and there , that is not permissible.  

positives :-
1)i should be affirmed by now , as my that teacher of mine said and that lawyer as well , that i have capabilities , ki tu kuch bhi kar skta h , and that i have risen myself into an iit , and by my past experiences , that hadbadaahat mere liye sahi nhi , iss liye i affirm u one thing , shaant mann rakhna seekh jaa , aur tujhe sab kuch milega jo tu chahta tha , kyuki trust me u have the potential , u have everything , aand u can do everything , its just that shaant mann rakh and trust the process u are following.

likes :-
1) i like to teach , remember the moment and joy u got , u literally jumped out of joy once u got out of his office , it felt like real thing , so yes teaching or to say discussing with profs is surely one thing that i love.

2) i love to learn about things , and boy i might not be sure of a lot of things , but i m sure of this one thing that i would never want to be out of practicing learning , i would want to learn each day of my life.
