Ideas

1)maybe if we can get a workforce in the form of A.I. once it is developed, then we can shift to like living lives like this ,living in community chunks, colonies, produce , create something in these colonies, some will develop , most will learn, and perhaps we'd be able to come up with something profound, just like the clubs working here at iitk, they are doing the same jobs that are done at companies, but on a small scale producing output no one purchases or uses, this output is created not for someone to use , not for someone to appreciate, art is not created for viewers, projects not done to solve problems , coz most of the projects are just somewhat replicas of what already has been created and is in use out there in the world, or most of the projects are not finished product to be able to be used out there in the world, it is for learning of these people, so they can learn to create things, and one day create one of their own.

2)the reason why asymmetric relationships , will not work is:
asymmetric means wherein u are putting loads of efforts to make her happy, and she gets happy as well , in the case where she doesn't , that would never work , so we discard that, now it's either she could be highly responsive, getting as much excited as u are when u do something or getting more excited than u, that's a really good response, other response could be , she feels very nice, she is not very much expressive, but she feels special when u do something for her, and she wants u to continue doing that. and a fourth case could be she is giving back actively. she is putting efforts , that isn't asymmetric, and that has a good chance of working well. in the second and third case, the problem is , agreed that u are getting good response, and that incentivizes u to do more, and perhaps works as a reward, but the problem is, u would actively push and put efforts when u feel good , happy, and energetic ,and lively, that's when u would put efforts and it will work well, but what about the time u feel dead , sad, and just like the above thing sadness also follows a loop,if not taken out of it. and perhaps happiness is what everyone wants at the end, and so even if her response makes u delighted , even if u have an active belief that she's the one, even if u feel happy just by being by her side, or just at the sight of her or just by her existing in the world at the same time as you, there will come a point when u feel dreadful , possibly due to other external reasons, but u would want her to help u out, and if she doesn't do that or is not able to actually do that. perhaps it will not work. symmetricity to some extent is imp. and symmetricity in its effect , not just her putting efforts , but her efforts making some change and helping u. mere having belief won't work, because the beliefs would be set into question once u start feeling vulnerable, the vulnerability might have external cause, but it would evoke some profound questions on ur relationships. the hormones would die down someday , the beliefs would get over someday, and then if the other person is incapable or unwilling to help u out. u would be doomed to misery.

3) the importance of making connections , faltu partiyon mei jaana faltu ke bulla session mei jaana , time pas krna iss tareeke se , these are very important , WhatsApp groups mei active rehna and i m not doing this , and so i know how jo log merese kam yogya bhi hain na , woh bhi ye sab timepas krke apna active participation dikhate h , voh log bas dikh jaate h aur fir unmei jo thoda bahut talent hota h , voh unke kaam aa jaata h, whin koi insaan jiske pas acha khaasa talent hota h agar voh apne room mei hi baitha h na, toh ussey opportunities nhi milti , plus its not just about opportunities, tumhe apni surroundings ke baare mei pta chalta h, kis tareeke ke log exist krte h, log kya kya kr skte h, original piece ko  produce krne mei zrurat hoti h , thodi variety of knowledge ki aur voh randomly hi milti hai , Apoorva ke chaapu hone wali news, plus tumhe logo se kese baat krni chahiye ye bhi aata h , iske matlab ye nhi hota ki tumhe language aati h ya nhi , ya fir sirf confidence ki baat ho , par logo ki different age hoti h , different work areas hote h, different status hota h , humara unse different relation hota h , ese mei kissey kya baat krni h aur kis tareeke se baat krni h ye imp hota h, laheja, aap rudely maana kr skte h , jese mana krna bhi ek art h, aur saamne vale ke nature pe depend krta h ki aap unhe kese mana kr skte h aur voh maan jaayega, ya logo ko convince krne h ek art h, logo ke saamne joke krne se aap unhe impress kr skte h, kuch intellectual baatein krke kar skte h, toh logo ko impress krna ek art h, kya baat krne mei , kitni disgusting baat , kitni gruesome baat , kitni inhumane baatein , kr skte ho uss group mei ye art h, kisiko shyad aap kuch baatein nhi bta skte , nhi toh voh kahi aur poke denge , ab maan lo vo apse voh baatein nikalwa rha h, toh aap kese karenge behave, decent behave krna , ye sab imp h , agar aap aage jaake esi settings mei rehte h toh , 
but notice mai har chiz nhi seekh skta , aur har chiz ko mai utilize bhi nhi kr paunga , kyuki mai har chiz nhi krne vala aage jaake , toh kyu na hum voh kare , jo hum aage karne vale h. and also u get to know some insights of things that are considered and clustered among what, this world is social in nature and so the society clusters and classifies acts in different sections, and if an act is an act of cheating is to be decided by them , and this can be inferred thru such insights. 

4)what do we value higher harmabe or the idea of harambe? and what will he value higher? recognition and appreciation and contribution like this , or a living a life? what do i value hgiher?

5)think of a story of , let's say god gave a purpose , to find a red sparrow. or to fill a bucket , and now each one of us are trying to do it, and if someone dies early, they will not be able to contribute to it much.this way one learns value of life, but why should one value life.. if i give u a very great excahnge with that, will u do it? we can think of life as something given to us for free, and we haven't been told what to do with it. u can throw it away, u can keep it safe in bank , currently due to mortality issues, it will fade away after a considerable amount of time, its like an elixir , noone knows when it will extinguish, one can loose it through carelessness, or trade it with something like insurance or get upset with it, and throw it in vain , this elixir ensures ur stay at those positions, and after that u disappear somewhere, some people try to look for the person who gave them this elixir, some look around and explore, there's an amusement park in the town, and some gets into enjoy their lives, u meet people who look like u , who claim to having got elixir, but their elixir is not explicitly visible to u. so there's no way u can tell that they are also given to u just like the rest of the world, but wait, is the rest of the world given to u, are u different from the rest of the world? well the fact that i m not able to experience the rest of the world , and my experience is local to this body of me tell me, that 

6) Where is the self in Self-proclaimed Revolutions ?? my attempt to peace down the indo-pak rivalry and my politicizing , environmentalist activist agenda , I'm a menace to this society and I must die or be weakened!

7) how the rich becomes richer , and poor becomes poorer, but its not just money, but attitude. the air of confidence that the rich comes with, gets them a reassuring attitude, which is liked by women , so they usually gets women more easily, that calm and composure that is shown by them, is what makes them more attractive, their dressing , and then the nervousness of a poor broke bloke, he loses everything,not just women , but in life as well. the article not just explores this idea of confidence helping one, but how the quality and traits of rich get them more success. and while woh darne vale attitude se tum nahi jeet paoge , its not just sacha , mehnati wala attitude giving u success, confidence , self beleief, aur bhi bahut saare time wasting factors , jismei tum actively kaam nhi kar rhe ho apni manzil ko paane ke liye par still tum ek better candidate ban jaate ho apni manzil ko paane ke liye than that person jo constantly ussey paane ke liye mehnat kr rha h.
kitna galat tha mai yeh sochne mei ki mehnat hi sab kuch hoti h, kitna galat hu mai yeh sochne mei ki woh insaan jo mehnat krega ussey woh chiz mil hi jaayegi , kuch aur bhi chahiye hota h, woh h achi health, taaki tumhare systems exam ke time kaam kreein, confidence to be able to write an answer, ek positive attitude after tumhare do teen attempts kharab ho chuke h kisi question ko solve krne mei, yeh sab bhaut faltu ke factors lgte h , par true h
it was like mene kaha , voh bkl toh merese kam mehnat kr rha h, voh kese jeet rha h, kya kar rhe ho, aur uska jawab aaya (bilkul woh tamasha vale buddhe ki taarah) toh mene kab bola ki mehnat hi sab kuch h, tujhe kya lgta h tu sirf kaam krte rhega krte rhega aur sab haasil kr lega , kaaayar ! tujhe woh qualities laani hongi, jo tu shyad laa sakee khud mei, par esa nhi h ki tujhe koi chiz ko paane ke liye har saamay uske liye kaam krna h , 

mai kabhi aur baat krne aaunga , ek chiz smjho, jo mai tumhe 2nd sem se kehte aa rha hu, tum shyad pure time ye nhi kr skte, par thode time kr skte ho, aur acha krte ho, thode time krte ho toh, toh everyday apne aap ke saath bitaane ke liye bhi samay nikaalo, kyuki tu bahut acha sochta h, thk h thk h, chal bye! 

8) humans are not so good with reasons, tum unhe reasons se convince kr sakte ho par kaam krne ke liye motivate nhin h, yeh sirf kahaniyan hi kr sakti h, jese jaini ne associate kiya h daksh se naa baat krna is equivalent to 2 se zyada chai na peena , mtlb din mei do baar chehra dekhna allowed h sukoon ke liye par teesra baar nhi , bcoz i don't want him controlling my life. perfect mixture of control , agar ek dum hi hata diya toh that would be being hard on urself aur thodi si zyada krne lag gya toh i ll let things slip out of my hand. how stories help us have better control than reasons. psychology can perhaps prove something like that.

9) how fests have slowly evolved to be not fakely enjoy , but getting back with people , making even stronger bonds with them,coz that's what will help u in future and that's what makes u truly happy from inside. and for this reason , its easy to get happiness, bcoz u don't really need concerts and bade bade singers for that, u nedd just one good friend for that , and that u can find in ur not so lavish neighvourhodd. iss liye bolte h khushi is not a matter of money.

10) which one is real happiness, cleaning the mess and shit out of ur head, jese uss rone wale session mei huyi thi , ya jese kal aur aaj huyi h, ya fir intiating a fake respnosive dance in a dj concert to help u cope up with things and enjoy or drinking wine and dancing with friends , knowing u can't do much about ur situation and instead of addressing or acknowling the issues, u choose to ignore them and intiate a fake dance and then getting into that flow, which happiness is real?
